'''
PART 4: Decision Trees
- Read in the dataframe(s) from PART 3
- Create a parameter grid called `param_grid_dt` containing three values for tree depth. (Note C has to be greater than zero) 
- Initialize the Decision Tree model. Assign this to a variable called `dt_model`. 
- Initialize the GridSearchCV using the logistic regression model you initialized and parameter grid you created. Do 5 fold crossvalidation. Assign this to a variable called `gs_cv_dt`. 
- Run the model 
- What was the optimal value for max_depth?  Did it have the most or least regularization? Or in the middle? 
- Now predict for the test set. Name this column `pred_dt` 
- Return dataframe(s) for use in main.py for PART 5; if you can't figure this out, save as .csv('s) in `data/` and read into PART 5 in main.py
