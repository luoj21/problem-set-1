PART 3: Logistic Regression
- Read in `df_arrests`
- Use train_test_split to create two dataframes from `df_arrests`, the first is called `df_arrests_train` and the second is called `df_arrests_test`. Set test_size to 0.3, shuffle to be True. Stratify by the outcome  
- Create a list called `features` which contains our two feature names: pred_universe, num_fel_arrests_last_year
- Create a parameter grid called `param_grid` containing three values for the C hyperparameter. (Note C has to be greater than zero) 
- Initialize the Logistic Regression model with a variable called `lr_model` 
- Initialize the GridSearchCV using the logistic regression model you initialized and parameter grid you created. Do 5 fold crossvalidation. Assign this to a variable called `gs_cv` 
- Run the model 
- What was the optimal value for C? Did it have the most or least regularization? Or in the middle? Print these questions and your answers. 
- Now predict for the test set. Name this column `pred_lr`
- Return dataframe(s) for use in main.py for PART 4 and PART 5; if you can't figure this out, save as .csv('s) in `data/` and read into PART 4 and PART 5 in main.py
